            <h1>Gustavo Fring</h1>
        </div>
        <p>
            Gustavo "Gus" Fring, mockingly referred to as The Chicken Man by Hector, is a Chilean-American restaurant entrepreneur and major narcotics distributor who primarily worked in Albuquerque, New Mexico. Originally collaborating with the Mexican drug cartel to distribute their cocaine, Gus eliminated his dependence on the cartel and began distributing methamphetamine himself. Soon enough he became the kingpin of his solo drug empire, which was the most successful drug operation in United States history until his former employee <a href="WalterWhite.html">Walter White</a> surpassed it with his own drug empire.
        </p>
        <p>
            Gus is the proprietor of Los Pollos Hermanos, a highly successful fried chicken restaurant chain which he co-founded with his business associate and partner Maximino "Max" Arciniega, and is also the owner of the industrial laundry facility called Lavandería Brillante. Gus uses both of these stores as a front for his meth distribution operation throughout the American southwest, supported by Los Pollos' corporate owners, Madrigal Electromotive GmbH.
        </p>
        <p>
            Gus maintains a positive public image; he is a booster for Albuquerque civic causes, including the local Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) office; in addition to befriending the special agent in charge, Gus makes large donations to the office's charitable events, and is a member of the hospital board. Underneath this outwardly pleasant front, he is calculatingly ruthless and dangerously Machiavellian in managing his drug empire by using his anti-drug philanthropy to conceal his true nature from the public. He employs a number of enforcers including Mike Ehrmantraut, and has personally killed both rivals and allies.
